# MorningCricket System Enhancements

This update introduces three major enhancements to the MorningCricket system, focused on improving the daily operations workflow, inventory tracking, and subscription management.

## 1. Daily Workflow Shortcuts

A guided, step-by-step process for completing daily checks and inventory management tasks:

- **Streamlined Process**: Reduces clicks and steps for daily operations
- **Auto-calculations**: Automatically fetches latest sales and stock data
- **Intuitive UI**: Clear guided workflow with numbered steps
- **Quick Entry**: Simplified input of physical stock counts
- **Auto Discrepancy Report**: Automatically generated after physical stock is entered
- **Discrepancy Resolution**: Dedicated form for tracking reasons for discrepancies

### Access Points:
- Dashboard card with "Start Daily Workflow" button
- Under "Daily Workflow" in the main navigation

## 2. Batch Implementation in Stocking

Enhanced inventory tracking with batch-specific information:

- **Batch-Oriented Stocking**: Track individual batches with dates, quantities, and bag averages
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain records of all past batches
- **Weighted Average Calculations**: More accurate bag average calculations based on batch history
- **Improved Transparency**: See which batch measurements are being used for calculations
- **Better Traceability**: Track inventory back to specific batch entries

### Access Points:
- Through the standard "Stock In" process (enhanced UI)
- Visible in stock reports and daily checks

## 3. Subscription & Access Control Improvements

More granular control over user access and subscription status:

- **Enhanced Subscription States**:
  - `active` – Full access to all features
  - `expired` – Login allowed but redirected to renewal page
  - `pending` – Awaiting admin approval
  - `grace_period` – Warnings but continued access
  - `banned/disabled` – No access permitted

- **Clear Expiration Indicators**: Dashboard warnings and countdown for expiring subscriptions
- **Improved Admin Tools**: Better subscription management for administrators

### Access Points:
- Admin subscription management panel (for administrators)
- Subscription status indicators throughout the application

## Installation

To install these enhancements, run the included upgrade script:

```bash
./upgrade-system.sh
```

This will:
1. Run the necessary database migrations
2. Clear application caches
3. Rebuild assets if necessary
4. Optimize the application

## Compatibility

This update is fully backward compatible with existing data. All current stock records will be automatically converted to the new batch system, and subscription statuses will be properly migrated.
