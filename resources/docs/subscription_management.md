# Subscription Management

This document provides an overview of the subscription management system in our shop management application.

## For Users

### Subscription Status

The application requires an active subscription to access most features. Your subscription status can be in one of three states:

1. **No Active Subscription** - You have not requested a subscription or have cancelled your subscription.
2. **Pending Approval** - You have requested a subscription but it has not yet been approved by an administrator.
3. **Active Subscription** - Your subscription has been approved and you have full access to all features.

### Managing Your Subscription

1. **Viewing Status** - You can view your current subscription status by clicking on the "Subscription" link in the navigation menu.

2. **Requesting a Subscription** - If you don't have an active subscription, you can request one from the subscription status page.

3. **Cancelling a Subscription** - If you have an active subscription or a pending request, you can cancel it at any time from the subscription status page.

4. **Understanding Status Indicators** - The subscription status is shown with clear visual indicators:
   - Green: Active subscription
   - Yellow: Pending approval
   - Gray: No active subscription

## For Administrators

Administrators with the 'admin' role have access to the subscription management system.

### Subscription Management Features

1. **Viewing All Subscriptions** - Access the admin panel via the "Admin" section and click on "Manage Subscriptions" to view all user subscriptions.

2. **Approving Subscriptions** - From the "Pending Approvals" page, you can approve subscription requests.

3. **Rejecting Subscriptions** - You can reject subscription requests if needed.

4. **Manually Toggling Subscriptions** - Administrators can manually activate or deactivate any user's subscription.

### Notification System

The system automatically sends notifications:

1. When a user requests a subscription, administrators are notified.
2. When a subscription status changes (approved, rejected, cancelled), the user is notified.
3. When a user cancels an approved subscription, administrators are notified.

1. Unlimited Product Management
